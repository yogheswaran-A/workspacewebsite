## Introduction

I am currently on the process of drafting it, will publish soon.

This blog contains the basics, derivations, intuition and idea behind diffusion models, score based models, and rectified flow. I have also explained how these formulations relate to one another and comes under the same umberala. I will start with each formulation independently and at the end we will see how all of these fall under the same umberela.
